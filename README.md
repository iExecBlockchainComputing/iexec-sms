# iExec Secret Management Service (iExec SMS)

## Overview

The iExec Secret Management Service (SMS) stores user secrets and provisions them to authorized Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) applications running on the iExec network.

### Details

* Confidential assets you have (password, token, API key, AES key, ..) should be securely transferred from your machine to the SMS over a TLS channel (iExec SDK is recommended). This operation is only done once.
* Internally, secrets are encrypted with standard AES encryption before being written to disk. 
* The iExec SMS secret provisioning policy is based on on-chain ACL (PoCo). PoCo smart contracts define simple ACL rules where individuals have ownership of on-chain objects they have deployed (workerpool, application, secret-dataset & requester).
* Each individual who is the owner of an object could define a policy on it. For example, "As a Requester (0xAlice), I only authorize my confidential Secret-Dataset (0xSecretOfAlice) to be used by the application of Bob (0xAppOfBob) I trust which will run on the Workerpool of Carl (0xWorkerpoolOfCarl)".
* When the secure application of Bob starts, the secret of Alice is written into a temporary session and sent over TLS to a dedicated  Configuration & Attestation Service (CAS) enclave responsible for communicating with the final application enclave.
* If the application enclave is legit (measurable with its mrenclave with Scone), it will receive the secrets.
* To sum up, if all checks are correct, the secret of Alice will cross the following environments: Alice-Host -> iExec-SMS -> Scone-CAS -> Bob-Scone-Application

## Configuration

The iExec Secret Management Service is available as an OCI image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/iexechub/iexec-sms/tags).

To run properly, the iExec Secret Management Service requires:
* A blockchain node. iExec smart contracts must be deployed on the blockchain network.
* A Scontain Configuration and Attestation Service (CAS) to provision secrets to remote enclaves.
* Valid OCI images configurations for pre-compute and post-compute stages of TEE tasks executions.
* A valid OCI image configuration of a Scontain Local Attestation Service (LAS).
  This service will be deployed by an iExec Worker to compute TEE tasks.

The iExec SMS can be started locally for development purpose.
It is not advised to use an instance with such configuration in production.
