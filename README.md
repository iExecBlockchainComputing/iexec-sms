# iExec Secret Management Service (iExec SMS)

## Overview

The _iExec Secret Management Service_ (SMS) stores user secrets and provisions them to authorized Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) applications running on the iExec network.

Two TEE frameworks for TEE tasks are supported on the iExec platform:

* Scone
* Gramine

### Details

* Confidential assets you have (password, token, API key, AES key, ..) should be securely transferred from your machine to the SMS over a TLS channel (iExec SDK is recommended). This operation is only done once.
* Internally, secrets are encrypted with standard AES encryption before being written to disk. 
* The iExec SMS secret provisioning policy is based on on-chain ACL (PoCo). PoCo smart contracts define simple ACL rules where individuals have ownership of on-chain objects they have deployed (workerpool, application, secret-dataset & requester).
* Each individual who is the owner of an object could define a policy on it. For example, "As a Requester (0xAlice), I only authorize my confidential Secret-Dataset (0xSecretOfAlice) to be used by the application of Bob (0xAppOfBob) I trust which will run on the Workerpool of Carl (0xWorkerpoolOfCarl)".
* When the secure application of Bob starts, the secret of Alice is written into a temporary session and sent over TLS to a dedicated  Configuration & Attestation Service (CAS) enclave responsible for communicating with the final application enclave.
* If the application enclave is legit (measurable with its mrenclave with Scone), it will receive the secrets.
* To sum up, if all checks are correct, the secret of Alice will cross the following environments: Alice-Host -> iExec-SMS -> Scone-CAS -> Bob-Scone-Application

## Configuration

The _iExec Secret Management Service_ is available as an OCI image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/iexechub/iexec-sms/tags).

A single _iExec Secret Management Service_ instance supports a single TEE framework.
To support both Scone and Gramine TEE tasks, two instances of _iExec SMS_ must be configured.

To run properly, the _iExec Secret Management Service_ requires:
* A blockchain node. iExec smart contracts must be deployed on the blockchain network.
* Valid OCI images configurations for pre-compute and post-compute stages of TEE tasks executions. Exposed images depend on the type of TEE framework supported.
* A Secret Provisioner instance, in charge of provisioning secrets to remote enclaves. Each TEE framework requires its own type of Secret Provisioner.
    * for Scone TEE tasks:
        * a Scontain _Configuration and Attestation Service_ (CAS).
        * a valid OCI image configuration of a Scontain _Local Attestation Service_ (LAS). This service will be deployed by an iExec Worker to compute TEE tasks.
    * for Gramine TEE tasks:
        * an _iExec Secret Provisioner Service_ (_iExec SPS_) instance.

The _iExec Secret Management Service_ can be started locally for development purpose.
It is not advised to use an instance with such configuration in production.

To support:
* Scone TEE tasks, set `IEXEC_SMS_TEE_RUNTIME_FRAMEWORK=scone`, then configure the SMS with properties of all following tables.
* Gramine TEE tasks, set `IEXEC_SMS_TEE_RUNTIME_FRAMEWORK=gramine`, then configure the SMS with properties of following table.

## Health checks

A health endpoint (`/actuator/health`) is enabled by default and can be accessed on the `IEXEC_SMS_PORT`.
This endpoint allows to define health checks in an orchestrator or a [compose file](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md#healthcheck).
No default strategy has been implemented in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) at the moment.
